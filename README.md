# Omen

## Building

The app code lives in the `app` folder. Use `yarn` to install dependencies.

```bash
cd app/
yarn
```

Create a `.env` file. See `.env.example` for environment variables which may be set.

For Omen builds, use `yarn build`.

The `build` directory in the `app` directory will now contain the build to be served.
